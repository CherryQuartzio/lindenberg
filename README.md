# Project Lindenberg

Repo containing all needed materials for the project. The notebook file is where the code used in training and prediction lives.

## Repo structure
---
There are two directories. The images directory contains raw images. These are unprocessed. The data directory contains files specific to training. Most importantly, this includes the legend.csv, which maps an image in the images directory with a facial expression.
